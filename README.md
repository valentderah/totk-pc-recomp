# TotK Recomp

**TotK Recomp** is a static recompilation of *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom* (Nintendo Switch, 2023) into a native Windows x86-64 application ([docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **No game files are included.** You need your own legally obtained copy of *Tears of the Kingdom*, dumped from your own console: the base game and the 1.2.1 or 1.4.3 update. Instructions for obtaining those files will not be provided.
>
> The game is built from your files on your machine, so the result contains the game. It is for your own use. Do not share it.

## Status

Early development. The game is playable on Windows; visual bugs and crashes are still expected.

Report problems as issues, following [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Features

- Native code, not emulation
- Game updates 1.2.1 and 1.4.3, with saves that carry over between them
- 60 fps by default; up to 144 fps or the monitor's refresh rate (experimental)
- Custom resolutions (1080p, 2k...), supersampling and AMD FSR 1 upscaling
- 16:10 (Steam Deck, handhelds), 21:9 and 32:9 (ultrawide) game resolutions, with the camera and the interface in that shape
- In-game settings menu (F1) and performance overlay (F10)
- Keyboard, mouse and gamepad with remapping, rumble and gyro
- Xbox button prompts: a layout that keeps the Switch button positions and shows the Xbox labels
- Shaders prepared at install instead of during play

## Planned

- Mods made for emulators: unpack a mod into a `mods` folder
- VRR

## Installing

Requirements: Windows 10 or later, an x86-64 CPU with AVX2, a GPU with Vulkan 1.3 and `VK_EXT_external_memory_host`, about 36 GiB free during setup (20 GiB after).

1. Download `TotK-Setup-<version>-windows.zip` from [Releases](../../releases/latest) and unpack it.
2. Start `TotK-Setup.exe`. If SmartScreen warns about an unsigned app, choose *More info*, then *Run anyway*.
3. Pick your game files, the language and an install folder, and press *Start*. The setup builds the game once.
4. Play `totk.exe` from the install folder.

### Linux and the Steam Deck

Requirements: Linux 6.7 or later (SteamOS 3.8 qualifies), glibc 2.34 or later (Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12, Fedora 35 and
newer), the same CPU, GPU and disk space as on Windows.

1. Download `TotK-Setup-x86_64.AppImage` from [Releases](../../releases/latest).
2. Make it executable (`chmod +x TotK-Setup-x86_64.AppImage`, or Properties, Permissions in the file manager) and start
   it. On a Steam Deck, do this in Desktop Mode.
3. Pick your game files, the language and an install folder, and press *Start*. The setup builds the game once (about
   an hour on a Steam Deck).
4. Play `totk` from the install folder. For Game Mode, add it to Steam as a non-Steam game. The game recognises the
   Deck and starts with its own defaults (1280x800, 40 fps); `totk.ini` in the install folder overrides them.

To update, run a newer `TotK-Setup.exe` or AppImage on the same folder; saves and settings are kept. Settings are in the in-game menu and in `totk.ini` ([totk.ini.example](totk.ini.example) lists every key). Controls: [docs/controls.md](docs/controls.md).

## License

The project's own code is under the [MIT License](LICENSE); third-party code keeps its own license ([THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md)). The license grants nothing for Nintendo's game.

## Building from source

[docs/building.md](docs/building.md) lists the toolchain and the steps. Everything the build writes stays under `build\` and `generated\`, which git ignores; run `tools/check_content.py` before a commit. Testers: [docs/tester-guide.md](docs/tester-guide.md).

Most of the code and documentation is written by AI coding agents (Claude Code) under the maintainer's direction; the maintainer plays every build and decides what is merged. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) holds the rules they work under.
