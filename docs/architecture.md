# Architecture

How the Switch build of *Tears of the Kingdom* becomes a native Windows x86-64 program. The upstream projects it builds on are listed under Credits in the [README](../README.md).

## Starting points

Two MIT projects cover different halves of the problem:

| | LAS Recomp | MacNativeGames |
|---|---|---|
| Game | *Link's Awakening* | *Tears of the Kingdom* 1.0.0–1.4.3 |
| CPU | ARM64 lifted to C, runs on x86-64 | Original ARM64 code runs directly on Apple silicon |
| OS boundary | IPC services and SVCs | ~163 `nn::*` SDK functions replaced by symbol, 38 SVCs |
| Graphics | Own NVN layer on Vulkan, own Maxwell translator | NVN front end + Metal 4 back end, Ryujinx translator |
| Useful to us | Lifter, NEON-to-C lowering, Windows memory layer, tests | Everything TotK-specific: host behaviour, NVN front end, version tables, patches, shader list |

MacNativeGames cannot run on x86-64 as is: its CPU path executes ARM64 code natively. LAS Recomp's host only covers what *Link's Awakening* calls. The port takes the CPU half from LAS Recomp and the game half from MacNativeGames, and writes the parts neither has: a lifter that scales to TotK, and a Vulkan back end for the NVN front end.

## Pipeline

### 1. Input

- Base 1.0.0 (`0100F2C0115B6000`) and one cumulative update (`0100F2C0115B6800`), NSP or XCI, plus the keys of the user's console.
- ExeFS and RomFS extraction: MacNativeGames' Python extractor (Python 3.14 for `compression.zstd`, `.venv-py314`).
- Update merging: hactool at `1d64a83` with MacNativeGames' BKTR patches, built by `tools/build_hactool.py`.
- Verification: MacNativeGames' `expected-v*.json` hashes of ExeFS, RomFS and fonts.
- Primary version: 1.4.3, the last update; performance work targets it. It replaced all three modules of the earlier updates (new SDK 20.5.22, RELR relocations, audio renderer REV15) and builds with `--version v143`, `recomp/patches-v143.txt`. 1.2.1 is a second target on the same build path; 1.0.0, 1.1.2 and 1.2.1 share `sdk`, `subsdk0` and `rtld` byte for byte, so only `main` differs among them. Saves load on either.
- Windows driver: `tools/extract.py` runs the vendored extractors (`tools/vendor/macnativegames/`) and identifies the update by the SHA-256 of its `main`. hactool has no Darwin `funopen` here, so the base Program NCA is copied out of the NSP before the BKTR merge (about 17 GB of temporary space).

### 2. CPU: lift ARM64 to C

- Modules: `main`, `sdk`, `subsdk0`. `rtld` is dropped and linking is done by the host, as MacNativeGames does.
- Base: LAS Recomp's hand-written decoder (`lifter.py`) and NEON/FP lowering (`simd_c.py`, `simd.h`), MIT. Output: one C function per guest function, direct calls for `BL`, an address-keyed table for indirect branches.
- Rewritten for TotK scale:
  - generator runs in parallel processes, with bounded memory per worker;
  - jump tables resolved by our own symbolic pass instead of Unicorn, which keeps GPL code out of the shipped generator;
  - `LDXP`/`STXP` (128-bit exclusive pairs) supported;
  - no 64 MB limit on `main`; `subsdk*` loaded;
  - NZCV and the six most used general registers of each function kept in C locals instead of the `Cpu`
    (`recomp/flags.py`, `recomp/regs.py`): registers are stored back where they changed, before calls, SVCs and
    exits, and reloaded after them. A call reloads only X0-X18 and X30, as AAPCS64 has the callee preserve X19-X29 and
    SP; `gen.py --no-callee-saved-trust` reloads those too.
- Coverage oracle: MacNativeGames' NSO rewriter lists every site where game code touches the OS (SVCs, TLS reads, counter reads, `x18`, exclusive windows, jump tables): 68,968 sites in 1.4.3 `main`. The lifter must handle every one.
- Memory: guest address equals host address, all below 2^39 (IPC encodes 39-bit addresses). The heap, stacks and the alias region are reserved with `MEM_WRITE_WATCH`, so the graphics back end can ask which pages the CPU wrote since the last upload (`runtime/memory.c`).
- Indirect branches go through `rt_dispatch` (`runtime/dispatch.c`), which looks the target up in the address table and tail-calls it.
- Testing: LAS Recomp's differential harness, every lifted instruction class checked against Unicorn (test-only, never linked into the game).

### 3. Host

- Portable C from MacNativeGames: threads and synchronisation, IPC, memory services, fs/RomFS, time, account, applet, audio renderer and effects. The Apple pieces (mach VM, CommonCrypto, AudioToolbox, GameController) are replaced with Win32 and SDL3.
- SDK boundary at the `nn::*` function level, matching MacNativeGames. Only `audren:u` and `sm:` are real IPC services.
- Window, keyboard and mouse: Win32 (`gfx_window.c`, `input_win.c`). Gamepad and audio output: SDL3. Voice: libopus (BSD). Movies: the SDK's `movie::Decoder` is replaced by a host VP9 decoder over libvpx (BSD, static; `runtime/ov_movie.c`), because FFmpeg from MSYS2 is a GPL build.
- zstd: most RomFS files of 1.4.3 are zstd frames. The patch set `zstd` sends the game's two decoder entry points to
  libzstd on the host (`ov_zstd.c`, `TOTK_ZSTD_NATIVE`); the lifted decoder took almost three times as long.
- Settings and menu: every key with its default is in one table (`cfg.c`), read from `totk.ini` and `TOTK_*`
  variables and written back when the in-game menu changes it. The menu and the performance overlay are Dear ImGui,
  drawn into the swapchain image (`runtime/ui/`); their text is in `ui_text.c` (English, Russian).
- OS calls the host makes go through `runtime/platform/` (`platform.h`, `win32.c`), so a Linux or macOS host adds one file instead of touching the rest. The split is not finished: `tools/check_platform.py` lists the Win32 uses left in the other files.

#### Threads and cores

Every guest thread is a host thread. TotK assumes Horizon's scheduler: three application cores, a thread runs only on a core in its affinity mask, and a higher-priority thread takes a core from a lower-priority one. The game keeps per-core data without locks and relies on that, so the host models it (`runtime/kernel.c`):

- Three virtual cores. A guest thread runs guest code only while it holds a core; the others wait in a priority-ordered list.
- Preemption. When a waiting thread has a better priority than a holder on a core it may use, exactly one holder is flagged. The holder checks the flag at its next SVC and at every indirect call (`rt_dispatch`: two loads when nobody waits), checks again under the kernel lock that a better thread still waits, and only then hands its core over. The indirect-call check comes from SavageWindRecomp's BotW port; checking only at SVCs left a better thread waiting up to 26 ms.
- Asynchronous preemption (from MacNativeGames 8bf0893, on unless `TOTK_ASYNC_PREEMPT=0`). Game code can run for
  milliseconds with neither (`TOTK_CORE_DIAG=1` measures it): a waiter that has spun 250 us suspends the holder and,
  if its host rip is in lifted code at host depth 0 (not inside a host call or SVC), moves it to `kern_ap_stub`, which
  saves the volatile registers and gives the core up there. A holder of a guest mutex counts at the priority of its
  best waiter, and one inside an SDK spin lock (TLR+0x100 `disable_count`) is not preempted: its interrupt flag is set
  and the switch happens at SVC 0x36. `TOTK_ASYNC_PREEMPT=2` keeps those two without interrupting. The interruption is
  Win32 (SuspendThread, SetThreadContext); another host needs a signal handler there, as MacNativeGames has.
- Host work gives the core back. Queue submits, presents, GPU waits, shader translation, `nn::fs` calls and NVN memory pool setup run without a core (`NVN_BLOCKING`, `kern_core_away`), as the Switch blocks those threads in IPC, so a thread blocked in the driver or on a file does not hold up guest threads.
- Spin waits. Loops that only another thread can end (857 in 1.4.3, 864 in 1.2.1, found by `tools/spin_waits.py`, the
  nxnative search) send their back-edges through `rt_spin_gate`, which pauses the core once per pass and hands it to a
  waiter after 50 us of polling (`TOTK_SPIN`, `TOTK_SPIN_HANDOFF_US`).
- `TOTK_FREE_CORES=1` turns the gate off, for experiments.

### 4. Graphics

- NVN front end from MacNativeGames (`nvn_api_*.c`, `nvn_obj.h`, texture layout and deswizzle). The game records command buffers through it; nothing reaches the GPU until the game submits.
- Vulkan 1.3 back end in place of MacNativeGames' Metal one. At `QueueSubmitCommands` the recorded NVN commands are replayed into Vulkan command buffers (`vk_exec*.c`).
- Memory pools. Apple's unified memory let MacNativeGames use the game's pools zero-copy. The back end imports the pools as host memory (`VK_EXT_external_memory_host`). On a discrete GPU, pools bound as buffers are mirrored in device-local memory and the pages the CPU wrote (write watch, above) are uploaded before a replay; idle pool regions are made read-only so the write-watch queries skip them (`vk_memory.c`). GPU-rendered textures are written back when the CPU reads them: on a pool invalidate, on a CPU copy, and for small targets once the CPU waits for a fence (`vk_texture.c`).
- Replay thread. `TOTK_REPLAY_ASYNC=1` moves the replay off the submitting thread onto a queue at most one frame behind the game; reads of GPU results wait for the newest writer instead of draining the queue (`vk_backend.c`). It is off by default because no timing has shown a gain yet.
- Recorder thread. The Vulkan calls the replay makes into its command buffer are made by a thread of their own (`vk_rec.c`, after Savage Wind Recomp and LAS Recomp): each `vkCmd*` copies its arguments into a packet of a ring and the recorder makes the calls in order; calls into other command buffers are made at once; the recorder also ends the command buffer, and the submit waits until it has. In the town on an RX 9070 the replay takes 17% less time on the submitting thread. `TOTK_VK_RECORDER=0` makes every call on the submitting thread.
- Uniform snapshot. The game rewrites per-object uniform blocks on other threads soon after it submits the frame
  that reads them, while the replay still records it. At the start of a submission's replay every uniform range it
  binds from CPU-written pools is copied, and the draws bind the copy (`vk_usnap.c`, after MacNativeGames'
  `TOTK_UBO_SNAPSHOT`); without it, late draws read another object's matrix.
- Driver data. The NVN driver keeps a per-stage constant bank (c0) that shaders read for things like point size, dispatch size and base instance. The back end fills it the way the driver does.
- Shaders: the Ryujinx translator 1.3.2 with MacNativeGames' patches and ours (`tools/xlate/patches/`), built with .NET 10 NativeAOT as `totk_xlate.exe` and run as a separate process. Its SPIR-V goes to Vulkan directly. `tools/prepare_shaders.py` and `totk.exe --prepare-shaders` translate and compile the variants of MacNativeGames' shared list ahead of play (29,587 for 1.4.3); the rest are translated on first use and cached on disk.
- Pipelines: `VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library` where the driver has it. Shader stages are compiled ahead into libraries; a draw that meets a new state links them at once (fast link), and an optimised pipeline replaces the linked one when a background thread finishes it. Pipeline keys seen in play are saved and built at boot. A draw whose pipeline is not ready is skipped when one of its pass's targets was rendered in the previous frame, and waits otherwise, so one-shot passes are never lost; a full-screen draw is skipped as well rather than waiting (`TOTK_PIPE_SKIP`); the stage libraries a waiting draw needs are built on idle workers in parallel (`TOTK_PIPE_WAIT`). Without the extension, a missing pipeline is built on a worker and the draw waits or is skipped by the same rule.
- Resolution. Patch sets make the game read its output, swapchain and scene sizes from the patch page
  (MacNativeGames' sites); `resolution.c` sets them from `output_res` and `render_scale` and grows the texture heap
  and the application pool to match. When the window is larger than the output, `vk_fsr.c` runs AMD FSR 1 (EASU,
  RCAS) on the present. An `output_res` that is not 16:9 (more than 1% off, `res_is_16x9`) also switches on the
  `aspect` patch set, which hands the output's ratio to the camera, and `romfs.c` `overlay_init` loads the
  `romfs-patches-<w>x<h>` overlay for it when it exists (`tools/make_romfs_patches.py --aspect`, laid out by
  `tools/ultrawide_layout.py`; the installer builds ten sizes: 21:9 2560x1080, 3440x1440, 3840x1600, 5120x2160, 32:9
  3840x1080, 5120x1440 and 16:10 1280x800, 1680x1050, 1920x1200, 2560x1600). A wider layout moves the HUD to the
  screen's corners, a narrower one to its top and bottom edges. Other sizes get the camera of their shape and the 16:9
  HUD stretched over it. The `aspect` setting (`fit`, the default; `stretch`) decides what the present does
  when the window's shape differs from the output's: `fit` letterboxes, where a 16:9 game in a wider window used to be
  stretched.
- Occlusion queries never block the CPU; a result that is not ready counts as visible.
- ASTC textures are uploaded as they are where the device reports `textureCompressionASTC_LDR`, and decoded by a compute shader everywhere else (`vk_astc.c`, `TOTK_ASTC`). The CPU decoder (`tex_astc*.c`) is the fallback and the test oracle.
- Draw state. A draw whose program, bound state and textures repeat reuses the previous draw's shaders and skips rebuilding its descriptor sets; descriptor sets are written through update templates (`vk_exec_draw.c`, `vk_pipeline.c`).
- Allocation: Vulkan Memory Allocator. Debugging: Vulkan validation layers, per-pass frame dumps (`TOTK_DUMP`, `vk_dump.c`) and a flight recorder (`TOTK_FLIGHT`). RenderDoc cannot capture, because it hides `VK_EXT_external_memory_host` from the application.

Maxwell behaviour the back end has to match, and the TotK bugs other ports fixed: [maxwell.md](maxwell.md).

Why Vulkan rather than D3D12 or wgpu:

- The translator emits SPIR-V, which Vulkan consumes as is. D3D12 would add a SPIR-V to DXIL step; wgpu would add SPIR-V to WGSL through Naga and drop features the game uses (bindless textures, some atomics).
- LAS Recomp's Vulkan back end is a working reference on Windows.
- The same back end runs on Linux.

### 5. Toolchain

- Generated C: MSYS2 UCRT64 Clang + LLD. The generated code uses GNU extensions (`__int128`, `musttail`, vector types) that `cl.exe` cannot compile.
- Host code: the same Clang, C11.
- Builds: `tools/build_game.py` writes a Ninja file and runs MSYS2 Ninja. Every object is hashed before linking, because a faulty RAM module once flipped bits in stored objects.
- Analysis: Ghidra with the Switch loader, Capstone, `llvm-objdump`.
- Players: the installer ([installer.md](installer.md)) builds the game code on the player's machine with a bundled llvm-mingw, so no recompiled code is ever distributed.
