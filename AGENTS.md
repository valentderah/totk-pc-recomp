# TotK Recomp

Native *Tears of the Kingdom* targets: Windows x86-64 C lift/Vulkan and macOS ARM64/Metal 4. Design: [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md). Windows builds: [docs/building.md](docs/building.md). Native macOS builds and checks: [docs/macos.md](docs/macos.md).

## Game content boundary

This repository is public. Game data lives outside it and every derived file stays in ignored folders.

- The user's game and key paths are in `config.local.toml` (ignored). Pass the keys file path to tools; the tools read it themselves. Key values stay out of your output, logs, commands and files.
- Everything extracted or generated goes under `build/` or `generated/`.
- Every file the code generator emits carries the marker defined as `GENERATED_MARKER` in `tools/check_content.py`.
- Run `python tools/check_content.py --staged` before proposing a commit. It is the same check CI runs.

## Reusing code

`refs/` holds the upstream checkouts (`tools/fetch_refs.sh` recreates it). Read-only.

- Copy only MIT, BSD, ISC, zlib or Apache-2.0 code, keep its header, and add a row to `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
- yuzu, suyu, OpenSmash-Ultimate and other GPL code: read for behaviour, write our own.
- `tools/vendor/` stays byte-identical to upstream; Windows changes go in `tools/extract.py`.

## Code

- Windows: build C with MSYS2 UCRT64 Clang (`C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin`). Generated C uses GNU extensions, so `cl.exe` is out. Call Ninja from that directory by full path or put it first on PATH.
- macOS: use `tools/build_macos.py` or `tools/build_game.py --target macos-arm64`. Native upstream edits are tracked patches in `runtime/macos/patches/`, applied to an ignored export. Never edit `refs/`. Run the native save, layout, presentation, shader and GPU checks documented in `docs/macos.md` for the affected paths.
- Two Python environments: `.venv` (3.12) for the lifter and the build, `.venv-py314` for the extraction and shader scripts, which need `compression.zstd`.
- Generated C is never edited by hand: change the generator (`recomp/`).
- Every lifter change passes the differential tests against Unicorn ([docs/building.md](docs/building.md), "Checks"). After changing `recomp/jumptables.py`, `tests\jumptables_check.py` reports 0 disagreements on 1.2.1 and 1.4.3.
- `recomp/layout.py` alone decides module bases.
- Graphics bugs: [docs/maxwell.md](docs/maxwell.md) lists the Maxwell behaviour the Vulkan path must match and the TotK bugs other ports fixed.
- Comments say what the code does and why, in words that stand on their own. Cite our code by file plus function (a line number may follow as a hint) and upstream code by project, file and function: `refs/` moves, so its line numbers rot. Commit hashes belong to the attribution of copied code.

## Writing

Code, comments, docs and commit messages are in English. Commit messages are plain sentences without type prefixes.
